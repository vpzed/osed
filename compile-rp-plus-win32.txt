Okay, you can generate a 32-bit solution this way:

rp\src>mkdir build32
rp\src\build32>cd build32
rp\src\build32>cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A Win32

Then you can compile the solution with VS.

vpzed notes:
- Open Visual Studio Community and open the source folder
- Open Developer Command Prompt from inside VS and follow instructions above from 0vercl0k
- Open the newly created build32\rp++.sln solution file in Visual Studio
- Switch Solution Configuration to Release and Build
